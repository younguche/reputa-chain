TrustScore — Decentralized Reputation System (Clarity Smart Contract)

Overview
**TrustScore** is a decentralized reputation and trust scoring system built on the **Stacks blockchain** using **Clarity**.  
It enables users, DAOs, and decentralized applications to assess credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness directly on-chain — without relying on centralized intermediaries.

This smart contract assigns each registered user a **reputation score**, which evolves through peer ratings, activity, and time-based decay.  
The goal is to provide a **tamper-proof and transparent trust layer** for Web3 ecosystems such as DAOs, DeFi protocols, marketplaces, and social dApps.
